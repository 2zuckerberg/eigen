### Docs

Get setup [here](docs/getting_started.md). Further documentation can be found in the [documentation folder](docs#readme).

### OSS Quick Start

Want to get the app running as an OSS project? Run this in your shell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/artsy/eigen.git
cd eigen
bundle install
make oss
bundle exec pod install
open Artsy.xcworkspace
```

This will set you up on our staging server, you will have a running version of the Artsy app by hitting `Build > Run`.

### Work at Artsy?

Instead of `make oss` in the above, run `make artsy` to set up [spacecommander](https://github.com/square/spacecommander). Make sure you have an environment variable of `ARTSY_STAFF_MEMBER` set to be true too.
